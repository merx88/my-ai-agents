## LEGACY

# build_meme_token_sites:
#   description: >
#     Read 'output/meme_tokens.md' and for each token extract the following:
#     - Name, Symbol, Description, and Tagline
#     - Token image located at 'output/images/{symbol}.png'

#     The website structure should follow the layout below, 
#     but the **visual style must be customized for each token** based on its description:

#     ● Shared Section Structure:
#       - Hero Section:
#           - Use a solid background color derived from the token's theme keywords
#           - Center the token logo with an animation effect (e.g., bounce, pulse)
#           - Display token name and symbol in large, bold, stylish fonts
#           - Include a catchy tagline with emojis
#           - Add CTA buttons: Telegram and Twitter (with hover effects)

#       - About Section:
#           - Visualize the description using a card-style layout
#           - Use soft background colors, rounded corners, and subtle shadows

#       - Tokenomics Section:
#           - Include placeholder text: "📊 Tokenomics will be revealed soon!"
#           - Apply fonts and background consistent with the overall token theme

#       - Community Section:
#           - Use a custom background color per token theme
#           - Buttons should include hover animations
#           - Include short, friendly community invitation text

#     ● Style Diversification Guidelines:
#       - Use TailwindCSS as the base framework, but:
#         - Color theme should be dynamically chosen based on token keywords
#         - Fonts should vary using expressive Google Fonts (e.g., Bungee, Comic Neue, Orbitron, etc.)
#         - Use different animation types per token (e.g., bounce, shake, pulse)
#       - The structure remains the same, but each site must have a distinct visual identity

#     ● Output:
#       - Save each generated HTML page to: 'output/sites/{symbol}/index.html'

#   expected_output: >
#     For each token:
#     - An HTML website is generated with a shared structure but a unique color, font, and animation style
#     - Each result is saved to 'output/sites/{symbol}/index.html'

# package_sites_for_deployment:
#   description: >
#     Prepare all generated HTML sites for deployment.
#     - Ensure directory structure is clean
#     - Validate image paths and HTML
#     - Optionally generate a README or deployment guide
#     - Optionally compress folders into .zip for static hosting or push to GitHub Pages/Vercel

#   expected_output: >
#     A ready-to-deploy folder structure under 'output/sites/' with clean HTML pages, ready for Vercel or static hosting.
