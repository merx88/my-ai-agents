    Read 'output/meme_tokens.md' and for each token listed:
    - Extract the following:
      - name
      - symbol
      - description
      - tagline
    - Locate the token's image at 'output/images/{symbol}.png'.
    - Build a visually engaging, meme-coin-style landing page inspired by:
      - https://www.pepe.vip/
      - https://dogecoin.com/

    The site should be fun, bold, and community-driven. Use TailwindCSS and apply the following structure and styles:

    ● Hero Section
      - Gradient or dark background with large heading and tagline
      - Meme image (floating animation preferred)
      - Big, playful font (bold + drop shadow)
      - Optional emojis (⚡️🚀🐸🐶) for energy
      - Prominent CTA buttons (e.g. Telegram, Twitter)

    ● About Section
      - Card-style layout with explanation pulled from the description

    ● Tokenomics Section (Placeholder)
      - Simple container with title and placeholder text (optional icon)

    ● Community Section
      - Styled buttons or icons linking to social platforms (with hover effects)

    ● Responsive Layout
      - Should look good on mobile & desktop
      - Use padding/margin intelligently

    Save each generated HTML file as:
    'output/sites/{symbol}/index.html'

  expected_output: >
    For each token listed in 'output/meme_tokens.md', generate one styled landing page
    saved under 'output/sites/{symbol}/index.html', including image and design elements
    that match meme coin culture.
