## 3. 차은우 (Cha Eun-woo)

**Symbol:** ARMY

**Image Prompt:** An iconic, striking full-body portrait of Cha Eun-woo, sharply dressed in a brand-new, perfectly fitted South Korean military uniform. His military-cut hair is neat, and his gaze is direct and confident, with a subtle, determined smile that conveys both farewell and a promise of return. He stands firmly on a clean, sunlit concrete ground, symbolizing a new beginning. The background is intentionally clean and slightly blurred, focusing on Cha Eun-woo as the central, monumental figure, with only a hint of a majestic, modern military building or a stylized national flag softly in the distance. The image should evoke a sense of pride, anticipation, and a new chapter. The lighting is bright and clear, emphasizing his readiness and strength.
